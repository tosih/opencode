# DEEP ANALYSIS MODE

Perform a comprehensive analysis using multi-phase expert consultation and parallel research.

## Analysis Protocol

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Parallel Swarm)

Launch immediately:
```
background_task(agent="explore", prompt="Map relevant code structure...")
background_task(agent="explore", prompt="Find related patterns...")
background_task(agent="librarian", prompt="Research best practices for...")
```

While swarm runs, use direct tools:
- `glob` to find relevant files
- `grep` to identify patterns
- `read` to understand key code

### Phase 2: Expert Analysis

Based on findings, consult specialists:

| Domain | Agent | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Architecture | `@architect` | System design, data flow, dependencies |
| Security | `@security` | Vulnerabilities, threat model, risks |
| Reliability | `@sre` | Scalability, SLOs, observability |
| Performance | `@perf` | Profiling, bottlenecks, optimization |
| Patterns | `@principal` | Code quality, best practices, tradeoffs |

### Phase 3: Deep Dive

Analyze comprehensively:
- Edge cases and potential failure modes
- Performance implications under load
- Security attack surface
- Error handling completeness
- Testability and maintainability
- Technical debt assessment

### Phase 4: Synthesis

Combine findings into actionable output:

### Medium (P2)
- [Issue]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. [Action with rationale]

### Short-term Improvements
1. [Improvement]

### Long-term Considerations
1. [Consideration]

## Trade-offs

## Analysis Focus Areas

| Area | What to Examine |
|------|-----------------|
| **Correctness** | Logic errors, edge cases, assumptions |
| **Security** | Input validation, auth, data protection |
| **Performance** | Complexity, caching, resource usage |
| **Reliability** | Error handling, failure modes, recovery |
| **Maintainability** | Readability, coupling, documentation |
| **Testability** | Coverage, mocking, isolation |
