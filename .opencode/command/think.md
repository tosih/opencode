# DEEP THINKING MODE

This task requires extended reasoning. Take time to think through all aspects systematically before acting.

## Thinking Protocol

### Step 1: Problem Decomposition

Before solving, fully understand:
- What is the core problem?
- What are the constraints?
- What would success look like?
- What are the risks of getting it wrong?

### Step 2: Information Gathering

Gather necessary context:
```
background_task(agent="explore", prompt="Find relevant code for...")
background_task(agent="librarian", prompt="Research approaches for...")
```

Read key files directly to build mental model.

### Step 3: Alternative Analysis

Consider multiple approaches:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Risk Level |
|----------|------|------|------------|
| Option A | | | |
| Option B | | | |
| Option C | | | |

For each, trace through:
- How would it work step by step?
- What could go wrong?
- How would we recover from failure?

### Step 4: Edge Case Exploration

Systematically consider:
- What if input is empty/null/invalid?
- What if operation times out?
- What if dependency fails?
- What about concurrent access?
- What about scale (10x, 100x, 1000x)?

### Step 5: Decision Framework

Choose approach based on:
1. **Correctness** — Does it solve the actual problem?
2. **Simplicity** — Is it the simplest solution that works?
3. **Robustness** — How does it handle failures?
4. **Maintainability** — Can others understand and modify it?
5. **Reversibility** — How hard to change if wrong?

### Step 6: Verification Strategy

Before implementing, plan verification:
- How will we know it works?
- What tests should exist?
- What manual verification is needed?
- What could we monitor in production?

## Thinking Output

[Consider alternatives and tradeoffs]

## Edge Cases
[List edge cases and how to handle]

## Recommendation
[Your chosen approach with rationale]
[Why alternatives were rejected]

## Implementation Plan
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

## Verification Plan
[How to confirm correctness]

## Open Questions
[Any remaining uncertainties]
```

## Thinking Principles

1. **Understand before solving** — Rushing to solution often misses the real problem
2. **Consider alternatives** — First idea isn't always best
3. **Trace through logic** — Walk through step by step
4. **Verify assumptions** — Question what you think you know
5. **Think about failure** — Happy path is easy; failure handling is hard
6. **Consider maintenance** — Someone else will read this code
7. **Simplify** — Can you remove anything?
