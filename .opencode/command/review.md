# CODE REVIEW MODE

Perform a comprehensive code review using the Principal Engineer agent.

## Review Protocol

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

First, understand what changed:
```
git diff [base] -- [files]
git log --oneline -10 -- [files]
```

Launch exploration if needed:
```
background_task(agent="explore", prompt="Find related code and tests...")
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Dimensional Review

Request Principal review with full context:

```
@principal Please perform a thorough code review:

```

### Phase 3: Specialist Consultation (If Needed)

For specific concerns:

| Concern | Agent | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Security issues | `@security` | Deep vulnerability analysis |
| Reliability concerns | `@sre` | Scalability, SLOs, observability |
| Performance concerns | `@perf` | Profiling, bottlenecks, optimization |
| Architecture questions | `@architect` | Design patterns, structure |
| Test strategy | `@testing` | Coverage, approach |
